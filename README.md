# Portfolio

This repository is used to host my own documentation and code. 

I hope that the documentation you find will be of assistance to your particular projects. 

However, I am not an experienced developer, and so the coding projects located in this repository will not be of any notable calibre.

Please visit the wiki for more information on my projects and interests, and what I've learned along the way.

Thanks for visiting.
